Pattern Recognition for Quantum Semiconductors

scalable algorithms to classify multi-domain signal patterns, integrating data pre-processing, model training, and reproducible pipelines for research in quantum semiconductor materials.

This is a specialized program for a specific dataset, not designed to be used for generic datasets. I am also unable to provide the dataset due to confidentiality reasons.
