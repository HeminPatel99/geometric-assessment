TO RUN CODE:

0. Make sure python has already been installed with the latest version (3.11.4)
	a. https://www.python.org/downloads/
1. Store the code file in a folder ("example_folder")
2. Have a folder called "GT6K" which contains the images in the same folder (we can change this name after in the code)
3. Right click anywhere in the folder, and select "Open in Terminal"
4. Once in Terminal Install the following if not done so:
	a. pip install opencv-python

RESULTS:
 - there should be new folders created with all files

FILES:
1 hex_outline: Shows what blue hex, red hex, green hex, and outter hex are. As well as distance variables for manual edits in the code.
2 Shouldbe_ratios. This file contains the optimal ratios for DOM 2.
